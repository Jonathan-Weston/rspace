# Full-stack Developer Role Take-Home Problem - Jonathan Weston

I have developed a basic front end application using thymeleaf.
It utilizes my apiKey to access samples i created within your API. 
Once running the front end will display the names of the created samples alongside the dates.

#Building & Running

mvn clean install spring-boot:run
```
open a browser and access localhost:8080.
```
Click the button to retrieve samples.
